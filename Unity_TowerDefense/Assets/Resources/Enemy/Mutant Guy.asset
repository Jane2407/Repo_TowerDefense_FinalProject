  enemyDescription: Mutant Guy, just a guy who thought it was a good idea to a take
    swim in a batch of toxic fecal matter at a toilet paper factory. This guy has
    an enormous amount of health, to the point it's almost radiating off him. He has
    moderately low armour and no magic resistance. For a mutant he moves sluggishly
    slow and leaves a huge explosive surprise upon defeat. He drops 50 bounty when
    defeated.
